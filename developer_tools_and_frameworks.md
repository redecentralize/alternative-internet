# Developer tools and frameworks

* [jIO](http://www.j-io.org/) is a client-side JavaScript library to manage documents across multiple storages, in a modular way, such as LocalStorage, WebDAV, Amazon S3, you name it.
* [Kademlia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) is a distributed hash table for decentralized peer-to-peer computer networks
* [OpenDHT](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht) is a lightweight C++11 Distributed Hash Table implementation offering a clean and powerful distributed map API. It is used by [Ring](https://ring.cx), is able to listen to value changes and adds a cryptography layer.
* [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db) is a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database. OrbitDB uses IPFS as its data storage and IPFS Pubsub to automatically sync databases with peers. It's an eventually consistent database that uses CRDTs for conflict-free database merges making OrbitDB an excellent choice for decentralized apps (dApps), blockchain applications and offline-first web applications.
* [RenderJS](http://www.renderjs.org) is a JavaScript library which provides an easy way to define gadgets (aka mashups) in pure HTML5, without requiring any application server. It is suitable for the development of mobile applications, desktop applications.
* [P](https://github.com/unsetbit/p) is a small JavaScript library for creating peer-to-peer applications in browsers. It allows for transitive connections across peers which makes certain network topologies, such mesh networks,easy to establish.
* [Shark](http://sharksystem.net/) is an open source framework for building semantic P2P applications in Java. It facilitates building decentralized application based on the notion of ontologies. The name is an acronym for 'Shared Knowledge'.
* [Streisand](https://github.com/jlund/streisand) sets up a new server running L2TP/IPsec, OpenSSH, OpenVPN, Shadowsocks, Stunnel, and a Tor bridge. It also generates custom configuration instructions for all of these services. At the end of the run you are given an HTML file with instructions that can be shared with friends, family members, or fellow activists.
