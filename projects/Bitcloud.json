    "name": "Bitcloud", 
    "description": "[Bitcloud](http://bitcloudproject.org) is an open source distributed cloud storage system and escrow agent based on Tahoe-LAFS that allows publishers to pay storage nodes for storing encrypted data and sharing that data with others. The decentralized nature of Bitcloud allows anyone to publish large amounts of data in a way that is free from censorship, high costs, and proprietary software.  The first application for bitcloud will be [WeTube](https://github.com/wetube/wetube-web), a platform for viewing and publishing videos, podcasts, ebooks, music, and other forms of media."
