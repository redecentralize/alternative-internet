    "description": "[Tribler](https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki) Aims to create a censorship-free Internet. Already deployed, used and incrementally improved for 8-years. Tribler uses an upcoming IETF Internet Standard for [video streaming](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ppsp-peer-protocol/) and is backward compatible with Bittorrent. Future aim is using smartphones to even bypass Internet kill switches. An early proof-of-principle [Tribler-mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tribler.mobile) is available on the Android Market. [Key principle](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2012/02/10/forget-megaupload-researchers-call-new-file-sharing-network-invincible/): 'the only way to take it down is to take The Internet down'.
