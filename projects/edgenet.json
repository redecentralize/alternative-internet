        "description": "The idea is to create a network of users for sharing data.  Instead of serving data from the backbone/trunk, data is served from the edge/leaves.  There are also to be measure in place to protect the identity/integrity of peers, as well as the entire network.  There will be very little central authority involved, probably only used in pointing new peers to a connection point on the network. \n\nThis will NOT be a p2p client, but a backbone on which to build more applications.  We are working to provide software that will connect to the network, then interface with applications to take advantage of it.",

It is a concept, with many layers already build (ZeroMQ, Zyre). It uses temporary 'cells' to connect devices and exchange information opportunistically. It's suited to decentralized chat and proximity networking.",
