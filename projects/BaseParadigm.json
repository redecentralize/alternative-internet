    "description": "[BaseParadigm](https://bitbucket.org/travisfw/baseparadigm/) is anopen source (GPLv3) library for managing a content addressable binarysemantic graph. Content addressability means enabling a number of dataexchange protocols (including p2p) for a developer usingBaseParadigm. Content addressable data is immutable, and so a semanticgraph is necessary for managing updates, annotations, reputation, andnavigational links. BaseParadigm lays the basis for a new paradigm fordata management that can be done offline as much as is desirable, andputs control over data storage, transmission, and processing back inthe hands of the user. Identity management becomes data managementrather than what it is today: contract management with third party webservices. Application interop is simplified from web API support tosimple graph queries. The user's experience is that all their data isavailable all the time in the places they expect."
