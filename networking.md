* [The FNF](http://thefnf.org/) is the free network foundation: teaching how to build wireless community networks.
* [Freifunk](http://en.freifunk.net) is a non-commercial initiative for free decentralised wireless mesh networks. Technically Freifunk firmwares are based on [OpenWRT](http://www.openwrt.net) and OLSR or B.A.T.M.A.N.
* [Funkfeuer](http://funkfeuer.at/) is, just like Freifunk, a non commercial initiative for free wireless mesh networks. Funkfeuer is based in Austria and uses [OpenWRT](http://www.openwrt.net) as the firmware for the Routers.
* [IPOP (IP-over-P2P)](http://ipop-project.org/) is an open-source user-centric software virtual network allowing end users to define and create their own virtual private networks.
* [LibreMesh](https://libremesh.org/) includes the development of several tools used for deploying libre/free mesh networks. The firmware (the main piece) allows simple deployment of auto-configurable, yet versatile, multi-radio mesh networks.
* [LibreVPN](http://librevpn.org.ar) is a virtual mesh network using [tinc](http://tinc-vpn.org) plus configuration scripts that even let you build your own mesh VPN.  It's also IPv6 enabled.
* [Loki net](https://loki.network/) is a privacy network which will allow users to transact and communicate privately over the internet, providing a suite of tools to help maintain the maximum amount of anonymity possible while browsing, transacting and communicating online.
* [Netsukuku](http://netsukuku.freaknet.org) is an ad-hoc network system designed to handle massive numbers of nodes with minimal consumption of CPU and memory resources. It can be used to build a world-wide distributed, fault-tolerant, anonymous, and censorship-immune network, fully independent from the Internet.
* [NYC Mesh](https://nycmesh.net/) aims to create a free, resilient, stand-alone communication system that serves both for daily use and also for emergencies—be it power outages or internet disruption—running software that helps our community with hyperlocal maps and events.
* [OpenNIC Project](http://www.opennicproject.org/) is an alternative DNS provider that is open and democratic.
* [PJON](https://www.pjon.org/) is an open-source network protocol able to connect devices using most physical layers and media, such as wires (PJDL, Ethernet, Serial and RS485), radio (ASK, FSK, OOK, LoRa or WiFi) and light pulses (PJDLS). It is released in a single portable implementation that can be easily cross-compiled on many systems like ATtiny, ATmega, ESP8266, Teensy, Raspberry Pi, Windows X86, Apple and Android. It is a valid tool to quickly build a network of devices.
* [People's Open Network](https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Mesh) is a community mesh network in Oakland, California.
* [Project Meshnet](https://projectmeshnet.org/) aims to build a sustainable decentralized alternative internet. Used by [Hyperboria](http://hyperboria.net/) and built on [CJDNS](http://cjdns.info/).
* [Skywire](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire) is the Skycoin Project's communication primitive (analogous to MPLS, open-flow, TOX, mesh networking, darknet, i2p) that facilitates mesh networking both on traditional internet service provider infrastructure, and on individually owned wifi and radio equipment, allowing for a phased, incentivized approach to decentralization. [Skywire Overview](https://medium.com/skycoin/skywire-the-new-internet-for-the-new-world-6d09a8542c50) | [skycoin.net](https://skycoin.net/) 
* [Yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/) is an early-stage implementation of a fully end-to-end encrypted IPv6 network. It is lightweight, self-arranging, supported on multiple platforms and allows pretty much any IPv6-capable application to communicate securely with other Yggdrasil nodes. Yggdrasil does not require you to have IPv6 Internet connectivity - it also works over IPv4.
* [ZeroNet](https://zeronet.io) enabled decentralized websites using Bitcoin crypto and the BitTorrent network
