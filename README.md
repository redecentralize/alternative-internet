## Techniques and ideas

### Decentralized storage of personal information

A proposal for [protection against identity theft](http://codeforcode.com/blog/2013/9/21/how-to-do-online-accounts-better) that works by decentralizing the storage of personal information. Using such a strategy would make websites less enticing targets for hackers and would allow users to be in control of where and how their personal information is stored.
