Your data is never stored in plaintext, and is impossible to decrypt without your passphrase.

* [DAppStore](http://dappstore.dappcentral.com/) is a fully decentralized App store focussing entirely on decentralized software.  Primarily to index DApps like Bitcoin, BitTorrent etc, but also indexes projects relating to DApps, wether that be a documentary, software library or coffee shop that supports a particular DApp.

* [Dendrio](https://www.dendr.io/) is a video distribution network that leverages the peer to peer WebRTC protocol to transfer website content between browsers.  This allows us to make data downloads faster for users but without any installation requirements.  For website owners, we are trivial to set up, and are transparent to existing CDN setups.  Our technology is geared towards streaming video and we support a multitude of different video formats and players.  

* The [Enigmabox](http://wiki.enigmabox.net/) is a ready to use cjdns appliance. cjdns is a public-key crypto network protocol, the fingerprint is your IPv6 address. This means, your IP is your identity. So we can use it for various useful things, e.g. as an email address or a phone number. We will start preparing existing internet services like email or VoIP to use cjdns in this decentral manner. Our goal is to encrypt the entire internet, make crypto accessible and make secure and decentralized internet services available for the rest of us.

* [Firecloud](http://firecloud.co) is a P2P web publishing platform in your using Persona and WebRTC to work its magic.

* [Lemon.email](https://lemon.email/) is encrypted and decentralized e-mail service. It can be totally decentralized (works as a [dApp](https://ipfs.io/ipns/dapp.lemon.email/)) or it can work as a mail service that uses IPFS/Ethereum as a storage for previously encrypted emails. The way encryption works is that the passphrase that is used to unlock emails is not saved anywhere and therefore nobody cannot read user’s emails. Also, third party email services cannot read or decrypt lemon emails, because only notification about incoming email is sent to those services and user must go to external link to read private email.

* [Lighthouse](https://www.vinumeris.com/lighthouse) is a peer to peer crowdfunding app that uses Bitcoin.

* [Project Byzantium](http://project-byzantium.org/) - Ad-hoc wireless mesh networking for the zombie apocalypse. The goal of Project Byzantium is to develop a communication system by which users can connect to each other and share information in the absence of convenient access to the Internet.  This is done by setting up an ad-hoc wireless mesh network that offers services which replace popular websites often used for this purpose, such as Twitter and IRC.

* The [Refuge Project](http://refuge.io/) aims to provide a fully decentralized and opensource data platform. It is built in Erlang and includes [RCouch](https://github.com/refuge/rcouch), a static distribution of couchdb using rebar, and [Coffer](https://github.com/refuge/coffer), a blob server.

* [Tavern](https://tavern.com/) is a distributed, anonymous, unblockable network designed to ensure that no one is silenced, censored, or cut off from the rest of the world

* [Younity](http://getyounity.com/) is a "personal cloud" that lets users share their files between their devices, without uploading them to one centralised server.
