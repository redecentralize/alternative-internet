|Askemos|A fast and trustworthy foundation on which to build applications: Byzantine fault-tolerant P2P computation and storage.[Askemos](http://askemos.org) creates an "autonomous virtual execution environment for applications" - designed to be tamper-proof and fault tolerant.  Users share not only static files but dynamic objects too. Code is taken as equivalent to contracts ("smart contracts") and hosts check each others compliance.It executes the code on several different machines, runtime libraries, compilers, operating systems etc. in parallel. Signed cryptographic hash are compared/stored for every transaction. Thus, this counters subversion of various components, eliminating the need to trust.|Scheme|100 |79 K|1 |-|

|BaseParadigm|[BaseParadigm](https://bitbucket.org/travisfw/baseparadigm/) is anopen source (GPLv3) library for managing a content addressable binarysemantic graph. Content addressability means enabling a number of dataexchange protocols (including p2p) for a developer usingBaseParadigm. Content addressable data is immutable, and so a semanticgraph is necessary for managing updates, annotations, reputation, andnavigational links. BaseParadigm lays the basis for a new paradigm fordata management that can be done offline as much as is desirable, andputs control over data storage, transmission, and processing back inthe hands of the user. Identity management becomes data managementrather than what it is today: contract management with third party webservices. Application interop is simplified from web API support tosimple graph queries. The user's experience is that all their data isavailable all the time in the places they expect.|-|-|-|-|-|

Samizdat provides strong cryptography for authentication of users over the network, and full disk encryption for installed systems, providing novice users fully-automated (zero-learning-curve) access to high-grade security.  Samizdat's installer does not ask any questions of the user except where to install.  The goal of Samizdat is to provide the benefits of public key cryptography to users who do not even understand what public key cryptography is.(Samizdat is also -- incidentally -- a generic framework for creating and managing LiveCD images for other purposes, such as managing multiple systems on a LAN, or system backup.)Send mail to samizdat@lists.riseup.net (public mailing list) or samizdat@childrenofmay.org (private email of project founder) for more information.|-|-|-|-|-|
