The goal is promoting free, open protocols, standards and software and to power end-to-end encrypted voice communications on mobile devices and desktop computers. They use standards such as SRTP, ZRTP, and SIP(over TLS). Clients are available for nearly every platform; [Now offline](https://guardianproject.info/2017/08/10/ostel.co-is-permanently-offline/)

* [Syme](https://getsyme.com) is an experimental project that aims at bringing more privacy and security to online communication through end-to-end encryption. Syme's zero-knowledge key infrastructure enables persistent multiparty communication and secure key exchanges on minimally trusted servers and relays.

* [Telehash](http://telehash.org/) a new encrypted P2P JSON-based protocol enabling developers to quickly build apps that are distributed and private (see the [protocol](https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/blob/master/protocol.md) spec)

* [unSYSTEM](http://unsystem.net/) is a collective dedicated to creating popular tools that promote privacy, independence, and integrity in contradistinction to those used for mass surveillance and suppression.  Software projects include [Libbitcoin](https://libbitcoin.dyne.org/), [SX](https://sx.dyne.org/), and [Lorea](#Lorea).

* [Avatar](http://avatar.ai) is a distributed "operating system for the internet" running inside the web browser. It allows for secure messaging (think email, social networks) and distributed data storage, employing a policy of "privacy and data security by default". Building its own encrypted P2P network, it does not rely upon any central authority. (Appears to be inactive)

* [BitPhone](http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/projects/bitphone/) is a mobile communications device with the features of a modern smartphone built on top of decentralized BitCoin-style proof-of-work networking.

* [Coinpunk](http://coinpunk.org/) is a web application that allows anyone to run their own self-hosted Bitcoin wallet service that is accessible from your web browser anywhere in the world. It's free, open source, and you can install it on your server right now.

* [CryptAByte](https://cryptabyte.com/) CryptAByte.com is a free online drop box that enables secure (encrypted) message and file sharing over the web using a public-key infrastructure. Messages and files are encrypted using a public key and can only be decrypted using the passphrase entered when your key is created. Your data is never stored in plaintext, and is impossible to decrypt without your passphrase.

* [DAppStore](http://dappstore.dappcentral.com/) is a fully decentralized App store focussing entirely on decentralized software.  Primarily to index DApps like Bitcoin, BitTorrent etc, but also indexes projects relating to DApps, wether that be a documentary, software library or coffee shop that supports a particular DApp.

* [DeadC](http://deadc.net/) Create a one-click expiring link (NB: Uses Google Analytics...)

* [Dendrio](https://www.dendr.io/) is a video distribution network that leverages the peer to peer WebRTC protocol to transfer website content between browsers.  This allows us to make data downloads faster for users but without any installation requirements.  For website owners, we are trivial to set up, and are transparent to existing CDN setups.  Our technology is geared towards streaming video and we support a multitude of different video formats and players.  

* The [Enigmabox](http://wiki.enigmabox.net/) is a ready to use cjdns appliance. cjdns is a public-key crypto network protocol, the fingerprint is your IPv6 address. This means, your IP is your identity. So we can use it for various useful things, e.g. as an email address or a phone number. We will start preparing existing internet services like email or VoIP to use cjdns in this decentral manner. Our goal is to encrypt the entire internet, make crypto accessible and make secure and decentralized internet services available for the rest of us.

* [Firecloud](http://firecloud.co) is a P2P web publishing platform in your using Persona and WebRTC to work its magic.

* [GitTorrent](https://github.com/cjb/GitTorrent) is a peer-to-peer network of Git repositories being shared over BitTorrent.

* [Lemon.email](https://lemon.email/) is encrypted and decentralized e-mail service. It can be totally decentralized (works as a [dApp](https://ipfs.io/ipns/dapp.lemon.email/)) or it can work as a mail service that uses IPFS/Ethereum as a storage for previously encrypted emails. The way encryption works is that the passphrase that is used to unlock emails is not saved anywhere and therefore nobody cannot read userâ€™s emails. Also, third party email services cannot read or decrypt lemon emails, because only notification about incoming email is sent to those services and user must go to external link to read private email.

* [Lighthouse](https://www.vinumeris.com/lighthouse) is a peer to peer crowdfunding app that uses Bitcoin.

* [Project Byzantium](http://project-byzantium.org/) - Ad-hoc wireless mesh networking for the zombie apocalypse. The goal of Project Byzantium is to develop a communication system by which users can connect to each other and share information in the absence of convenient access to the Internet.  This is done by setting up an ad-hoc wireless mesh network that offers services which replace popular websites often used for this purpose, such as Twitter and IRC.

* The [Refuge Project](http://refuge.io/) aims to provide a fully decentralized and opensource data platform. It is built in Erlang and includes [RCouch](https://github.com/refuge/rcouch), a static distribution of couchdb using rebar, and [Coffer](https://github.com/refuge/coffer), a blob server.

* [Tavern](https://tavern.com/) is a distributed, anonymous, unblockable network designed to ensure that no one is silenced, censored, or cut off from the rest of the world

* [Tidepools](http://tidepools.co) is being developed within the [Red Hook Mesh Network](http://oti.newamerica.net/blogposts/2013/case_study_red_hook_initiative_wifi_tidepools-78575), for addressing local, social incentives for mesh use. An Open Source, Collaborative, Mobile Mapping & Social Hub, Reflecting Community Needs & Culture through Custom Apps, Time-based Maps, & Data Feeds.
